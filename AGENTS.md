# AGENTS Instructions

This repository hosts the source code for **mariustoft.github.io**, a personal web page for Marius Toft. The site consists of a one-page résumé in `index.html` styled by `style.css` with a small helper in `script.js` for scrolling back to the top. Earlier multi-page files remain for reference.

Whenever the codebase changes or new features are added, update this file with a short description of the project to keep it current.
